The purpose of this lab is to be able to create a Multi-digit seven-segment display driver. It is important for students to learn and understand the anode and cathode of the seven-segment display. Students must convert the 4-bit BCD value to the 7-digit cathode value for the display. Each display will have itâ€™s own 4-bit input that corresponds to the number displayed. Students will write the Verilog code for the design, and also create a testbench to analyze. A ReadMe file must also be created.![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7ebee405-e1b9-4b28-a841-510a4577fa73)
